## RecyclerView Samples
This is a sample code for RecyclerView in Kotlin used in my YouTube tutorials.
It is written in **Kotlin**, but it will have a **Java** variation soon...

Links will be updated soon...

Feel free to check the code.
If you want, clone or fork this repo, then run it in Android Studio.
